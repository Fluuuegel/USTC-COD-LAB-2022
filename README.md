# This repo contains source code of my COD labs.

+ Directory **c2riscv** can convert C to RISC-V assembly code (you'd better just copy the assembly into RARS and generate binary code, cuz the generated `sort.coe` is problematical).

+ Addition and changes in lab4 including `rx.v` `tx.v` are served for lab6.

+ In lab6 you may change the memory file path in `data_mem.v`.

+ Lab reports are in the other repo of mine. [Click here to check it out](https://github.com/Fluuuegel/USTC-COD-HW-2022)
